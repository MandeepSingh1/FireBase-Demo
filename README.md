# FireBase-Demo
We have provided the functionality of register onto the firebase and then store your avatar object as a json into the Firestore.
We have also provided the functionality of login into firebase and then fetch the avatar object which you have saved in the process of Registration.

There is 2 View Controllers
1. LoginVC:- Where all the Login Process has been shown to the user with the dummy textfields like Email, Password. Then you can retrieve the Object from the 
call Backs.

2. RegisterVC:- Where all the registration process has been shown to the user with the fields like name, email, password, phoneNumber.
  After registration on firebase we are storing the objects into Firestore. 
  
Am Working on the projects and i haven't used this in the past. This is my first time if somebody finds any mistake please tell me i would love to work on issues.
